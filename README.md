# LinkShare

LinkShare is a web application that allows users to share their bookmarks (only works with Chrome at the moment). It uses S3 bucket to serve application resources, API Gateway + Lambda for REST APIs, and DynamoDB for data persistence.

To get started, you will need AWS-cli, local DynamoDB jar file, and terraform cli.
